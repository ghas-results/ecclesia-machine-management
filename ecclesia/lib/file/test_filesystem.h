// A utility class to make it easy to set up a filesystem layout for testing.
//
// The class is designed to be pointed at a directory which will be acting as
// the root filesystem. When used with googletest you can point it at either
// test_tmpdir or some directory within it. You can then use the utility class
// to create directory, write contents into files, and set up symlinks.
//
// This doesn't attempt to emulate a filesystem or anything like that. It just
// makes it easy to do a bunch of complex setup via a series of simple calls.
//
// This works best for setting up things like faked out /sys or /proc subtrees
// where there are lots of directories and small files and symlinks. If you need
// to use large files or binary files then bundling test data into your test
// may be a better choice.
//
// To keep the API simple and easy to use on failure the operation will log a
// fatal error. In the contexts of tests it is assumed that your operations
// should always succeed and so an error is either something catastrophic (e.g.
// your local test filesystem is broken) or a programming error in your test
// code. In both cases recovery is assumed to not be a priority.
//
// The functions are expected to be given absolute paths, with "/" corresponding
// to the root of the filesystem.
